              I will graduate in May 2018 and seek for full-time software engineer positions.
              I started Rose with zero programming experience as an <span mdTooltip="Electrical engineering" mdTooltipPosition="above">EE</span>.
              In my freshmen year at Rose, I found myself fascinated by smart algorithms and how much and how quickly I can do just by programming, so I switched my major.

            <p>
              Life at Rose-Hulman aren't so easy, which means I will leave fully equipped.
              I see every single course project as an opportunity to learn new technologies, so I always try something different each time.
              Therefore, I know so many <a routerLink="/home">new technologies</a>.
              As I wrote more codes, I found two things that excite me the most:

              This summer (2017), I am interning at <a href="https://www.groupon.com">Groupon</a> in Seattle.
              I am happy that I got work on an inventory supply team and learned so much about development and deployment practice within a <b>microservice architecture</b>.
              My intern project is removing one external dependency of our service by creating new endpoints and migrating data.
              I worked on mysql migration scripts, Java Ebeans entities and API updates.
              Working on a deployed system is so much different from a course project.
              Every deployment involving changes in API or workflow requires extreme caution.
              To mitigate the risks, we have to come up with meticulous rollback planning in case something goes wrong.
              I also become familiar with <b>agile process</b> and task management tools like JIRA.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel so lucky to have so many wonderful teammates who help and guide me through this internship.
              I learned so much in the discussions with my mentors and teammates.
              Intern life at Groupon in Seattle is so fun. I enjoyed Seattle sea foods and roof top grills with friends.
              I am actually surprised by how much free time I have after work. Perhaps I worked too hard at Rose,
              but I am so looking forward to my life after graduation!

              I am a huge fan of <b>Hadoop</b> ecosystem and <b>MapReduce</b> after I took the class with <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/faculty/mohan-sriram-mohan.html">Sriram</a>.
              It is an incredible growing community with so many <i>“cute animals”</i> to help us out.
              To name a few, I enjoy working with Pig, Hive, Hbase, Solr, Oozie, Sqoop, Zookeeper.
              I learned about Spark, Storm, Kafka and their ability to work with data in real-time.
              I use hive and pig to build classic shortest path finding engine using data set from <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">Open street map</a>.

              In the information era, I believe that traditional relational database can no longer scale in the era of the data explosion.
              To guarantee reliability, we need distributed file systems like <span mdTooltip="Hadoop distributed file system" mdTooltipPosition="above">HDFS</span> or GFS.
              With DFS, we can have luxury of storing the complete history view, and using MapReduce to extract any data we want.
              I am very excited for those advancements and want to build a robust and scalable system.
              In addition, when the system is required to be highly available real-time system, the trade-offs among <span mdTooltip="Consistency" mdTooltipPosition="above">C</span> and <span mdTooltip="Tolerant for network partition" mdTooltipPosition="above">P</span> become fascinating.

              I freaks out when coding becomes robotic-like chores.
              Here are two examples from both work and school. All of them have logical design and are used for many years.
              However, I do not like them because making changes involves tedious and repetitive work.
              The bad code smell here specifically is shotgun surgery.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                In order to add an additional attribute in an entity,
                <ol>
                  <li>Add it to the database table</li>
                  <li>Add it to the Java entity class</li>
                  <li>Add it to the Typescript entity class</li>
                  <li>Add it to the Python entity class</li>
                  <li>Add support in the manager class for this entity</li>
                  <li>......</li>
                </ol>
                Why not create a library that generates cross-languages entities and serialization codes?
                So we only need to modify one file and the rest is auto-generated.
                In fact, thanks to Google, we have <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">protobuf</a> that does exactly this.

              <br />
              <li>
                In order to add support for new syntax in this interpreter,
                <ol>
                  <li>Add a new data type to represent this syntax</li>
                  <li>Add an additional case in expression parsing phase</li>
                  <li>Add an additional case in interpreting phase</li>
                </ol>
                Why not create a interface called Syntax with two method parse() and interpret()?
                So we can group coupled procedures in the same place.
                I was facing similar issues in my <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Scheme_interpreter">Scheme Interpreter</a>, and ended in another way.

              My point is that software design matters. A good design saves development time and headaches when requirement changes.
              I learned so much about design principals and patterns from <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/course-catalog/current/programs/Computer%20Science/csse-374.html">Software design course</a> of <a href="https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/faculty/hays-mark-hays.html">Dr. Hays</a>.
              I want to work on extensible software that can grows, in particular libraries or frameworks used by a community.
              I want make impacts by applying design techniques to improve the productivity of the whole community.

              After many course projects, I also gathered quite web development experience.
              Many people prefer Angular or React over the other. To me, they are very different. Angular is a framework, while React is a library.
              I love them both especially when you can easily use React component within an Angular App.
              In fact, I build this website with Angular, but also uses a few React library, like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stonecutter">react-stonecutter</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For other common platforms, I also worked with Android, Chrome extension, ASP.NET and Spring Boot.
              Web development is such a rapid-growing area with numerous node packages for us to choose.
              One thing that I used quite often is Firebase. As a NoSQL database with real-time within built-in event event broadcasting and off-line support,
              Firebase makes building application that only needs CRUD operations so easy.
              I also used Firebase messaging for my Android app -- <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Jobee">Jobee</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had some web development experience, but I am not very particularly into building websites as a full-time position.
              However, I am always excited if I can contribute to those frameworks and libraries to help improve the community.

              It is hard to get to know me until you see the projects I worked.
              In the end, I want to describe a couple of my favorite projects from my projects. There are so many interesting one, so I regret that I cannot illustrate all of them here.
              How about my first project right after I learned Java in my freshman year? It is my wonderful <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Chess">chess project</a>.
              I love playing chess and I had so many free time in my <span mdTooltip="(They do not let my overload)" mdTooltipPosition="above">first quarter at Rose</span>, so I started this personal project.
              The code written by an newbie was functional but <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Chess/commit/7309b6d03c102e0c8ae55f55804d83edbef38d71">not so great in quality</a>.
              In sophomore year thanksgiving break, I learned MVC pattern and realized that bad design was the reason it became so difficult to add new features to this project.
              I spent that week refactoring the code base into MVC pattern because I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Chess/tree/ad5c9799e86579013170935618965c59cdbb7b11">make it great and add more features</a>.
              In my junior year, I took a software evolution class which focuses on improving legacy code through refactoring. I was glad that my team (Coco Liu, John Hein and me) chose my little Chess project.
              We worked ambitiously, not only improved code quality, added tests and new features, but also put it onto the web.
              MVC design pattern shines because we can easily inject a fresh new web view while having the rest of the code base untouched.
              We built the frontend in Angular4 and used Firebase as the tier between Java backend and web frontend (https://fredzqm.github.io/Chess/).
              I continued to work on my Chess app because I am passionate about what I enjoy and cannot tolerate mediocre result.
              The functional java applet created by the freshman newbie was functional but was going to die without a good design.
              I was not OK with spaghetti codes, so I spent time improving and growing them. This is just one of many projects I worked on and loved.
              I always pursue extensibility and have zero tolerant with poor design.
