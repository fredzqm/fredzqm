        I am a big fan of <b>Hadoop</b> ecosystem and the concept of <b>MapReduce</b>.
        I took a class about Hadoop and dealed with tools including Pig, Hive, Solr, Spark.
        I believe that any scalable system must be backed by a distributed file system like HDFS and MapReduce is a genius way of batch processing that scales horizontally.
        I want to work in this area, because big data analysis and reliable distributed database are the backbone of any high-available service,
        which makes huge impact on the market.

        This summer as 2017, I am interning at Groupon in Seattle. I am working on a Inventory Supply team.
        I am responsible for removing one external dependency of our inventory service by performing data migration.
        Since the whole system is a deployed production system, data migration requires extreme caution and careful planning.
        I am so glad I have a wonderful team that guided me to complete this task, and learn so much about deployment process in
        production system. I strength my database skills and ability to write quality well-designed code, as well as details of agile process.

        I have experience with and worked on projects involving <u>Angular, React, SpringBoot, ASP.NET</u>
