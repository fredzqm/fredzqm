        My name is Fred Zhang, a <span mdTooltip="Computer science" mdTooltipPosition="above">CS</span>/<span mdTooltip="Software engineering" mdTooltipPosition="above">SE</span>/<span mdTooltip="Computer engineering" mdTooltipPosition="above">CPE</span>
        senior at <a href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu" target="_blank">Rose-Hulman</a> with 4.0 perfect GPA in all major related courses.
        I will graduate in May 2018 and am seeking for full-time software engineer positions.

        As an overview of my technical skills, I am familiar with most common programming languages, including Java, C++, Javascript, Python,
        <span class="extraPlaceHolder">etc.</span>
        <span class="extra">C, C#, Typescript, Swift, PHP, MATLAB, Scheme, MIPS assembly</span>

        I am a big fan of <b>Hadoop</b> ecosystem and <b>MapReduce</b>. It is an incredible ecosystem with so many <i>“cute animals”</i> to help us out.
        To name a few, I enjoy working with Pig, Hive, Hbase, Solr, Oozie, Sqoop, Zookeeper.
        I learned about Spark, Storm, Kafka and their ability to work with data in real-time.
        I believe that any scalable system must be backed by a distributed file system like HDFS and use MapReduce to scale batch processing horizontally.
        In short, I want to build robust and scalable system to manage big data.
        In addition, I would be eager to work on any scalable real-time system, because designing and managing trade-offs among CAPs are one of my fascination.

        This summer (2017), I am interning at <a href="https://www.groupon.com">Groupon</a> in Seattle.
        I am happy that I got work on an inventory supply team and learned so much about development and deployment practice within a service-based architecture. My intern project is removing one external dependency of our service by creating new endpoints and migrating data. Working on a deployed system is so much different from a course project. Every deployment involving changes in API or workflow requires extreme caution and meticulous rollback planning. I am so glad I have a wonderful team that guided me to complete this project. As for technical aspects, I strength my database skills and ability to write high-quality codes. I also become familiar with agile processes and task management tools like JIRA.

        Besides all of these experiences, I also have many experiences with popular web development frameworks, like Angular, React, Spring Boot, ASP.NET.
        I built this website with Angular4 with a few React library (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stonecutter">react-stonecutter</a>).
        I had done many web application with Node, Webpack and Firebase. I like both Angular and React, especially when React component can live elegantly within an Angular app.
        It would be one of my dreams position to contribute to those fantastic frameworks and help the community.

        It is hard to get to know me until you see the projects I worked.
        In the end, I want to describe a couple of my favorite projects from my projects. There are so many interesting one, so I regret that I cannot illustrate all of them here.
        How about my first project right after I learned Java in my freshman year? It is my wonderful <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Chess">chess project</a>.
        I love playing chess and I had so many free time in my <span mdTooltip="(They do not let my overload)" mdTooltipPosition="above">first quarter at Rose</span>, so I started this personal project.
        The code written by an newbie was functional but <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Chess/commit/7309b6d03c102e0c8ae55f55804d83edbef38d71">not so great in quality</a>.
        In sophomore year thanksgiving break, I learned MVC pattern and realized that bad design was the reason it became so difficult to add new features to this project.
        I spent that week refactoring the code base into MVC pattern because I wanted to <a href="https://github.com/fredzqm/Chess/tree/ad5c9799e86579013170935618965c59cdbb7b11">make it great and add more features</a>.
        In my junior year, I took a software evolution class which focuses on improving legacy code through refactoring. I was glad that my team (Coco Liu, John Hein and me) chose my little Chess project.
        We worked ambitiously, not only improved code quality, added tests and new features, but also put it onto the web.
        MVC design pattern shines because we can easily inject a fresh new web view while having the rest of the code base untouched.
        We built the frontend in Angular4 and used Firebase as the tier between Java backend and web frontend (https://fredzqm.github.io/Chess/).
        I continued to work on my Chess app because I am passionate about what I enjoy and cannot tolerate mediocre result.
        The functional java applet created by the freshman newbie was functional but was going to die without a good design.
        I was not OK with spaghetti codes, so I spent time improving and growing them. This is just one of many projects I worked on and loved.
        I always pursue extensibility and have zero tolerant with poor design.
